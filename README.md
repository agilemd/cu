# Cu

Copper - a configuration utility and environment manager

Copper helps you manage and sync your dotfiles and settings so your
workspace is always how you like it, even on a new machine or across
devices.

Also, package and share your favorite settings in profiles to share
with your colleagues.

Note, this is a work in progress. You probably shouldn't use it yet.
